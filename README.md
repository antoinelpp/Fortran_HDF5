# Fortran and HDF5


Using HDF5 can be difficult, especialy in Fortran Code. I forgot myself how to use it.

This repository's goal is to propose simple snippets that can be used to create any H5 file.

# How to use

You will need to install HDF5 on your computer, and change the makefile accordingly.

Once HDF5 is installed, you can use the proposed code as you want. Just copy-past it in your own code to be able to write outputs in H5 file.

# Proposed snippets:

- [x] How to create a file with diff√©rent datasets
- [x] How to write Double Precission data into a simple precision HDF5 file
- [ ] How to write with multiple CPUs
- [ ] How to create groupes
- [ ] How to create Attributes
- [ ] How to read datasets and attributes

# How to contribute

Fork and PR as you will, every help is apreciated !
